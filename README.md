# Jumbler 3.0

This project uses a Markov generator to help with creative idea generation. It also uses a SHA-256 hashing algorithm and will have functionality to combine poems with artwork and see the hash. You will be able to mint an NFT of the artwork at any point and recieve special metadata if its hash meets rarity criteria. Four 0s are rare, the more 0s the more rare. 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
